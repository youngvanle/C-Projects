This program simulates a basic online shopping cart by prompting the user to enter details for two items.  It captures the item name, price, and quantity, and then calculates and displays the total cost.

## Features

- Object-oriented structure using a custom `ItemToPurchase` class
- Modular design with separate header and implementation files
- User input for item details (name, price, quantity)
- Output displays line-item costs and final total

## Files

- `ItemToPurchase.h` – Class declaration for item attributes and methods
- `ItemToPurchase.cpp` – Class implementation for setting and getting item values
- `main.cpp` – Handles user interaction and total cost calculation

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Class creation and usage
- Mutator and accessor methods
- Multi-file program structure
- Input/output handling and string manipulation
