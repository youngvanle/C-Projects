# C-Projects

This repository showcases C++ projects developed through structured labs and hands-on practice. The goal is to build a strong foundation in core programming concepts such as input/output handling, arithmetic logic, functions, classes, file operations, and modular development.

## Project Types

- **Applications/** – Larger, more complex C++ programs that integrate multiple concepts. These applications simulate real-world software behavior, incorporating structured menus, file handling, modular architecture, and user-driven workflows.

- **LabPractices/** – A collection of short, focused C++ labs that each target a specific concept or skill. These mini-projects demonstrate foundational coding techniques using realistic input/output scenarios.
