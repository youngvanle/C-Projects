# DualClockDisplay

This C++ program displays the current time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats using a text-based interface.  The user can interact with a menu to add one hour, one minute, one second, or exit the program.  Time updates are reflected in both formats simultaneously.

## Features

- Modular code using separate `.h` and `.cpp` files
- Functions to increment time (hour, minute, second)
- 12-hour and 24-hour time formatting
- Structured output with clean formatting
- Input validation and loop control

## Tools Used

- C++ (Visual Studio)
- Console-based interface
- No external libraries

## Learning Highlights

- Function decomposition
- Header and implementation file usage
- Loops and conditionals for user interaction
- Time formatting logic (AM/PM vs 24-hour)
