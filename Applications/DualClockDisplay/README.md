# DualClockDisplay

This C++ application displays the current time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats.  Users interact with a text-based menu to increment the time by one hour, one minute, or one second.  Updates are immediately reflected in both formats with proper rollover handling.

## Features

- Modular architecture using separate `.h` and `.cpp` files
- Functions to increment and format time
- Dual clock display with structured output formatting
- Input validation for reliable menu interaction
- Loop-based program control for continuous updates

## Tools Used

- C++ (Visual Studio)
- Console-based interface
- No external libraries

## Learning Highlights

- Function decomposition and separation of concerns
- Use of header and implementation files
- Control flow with loops and conditional logic
- Time formatting in both 12-hour (AM/PM) and 24-hour formats
